# Entities agent instructions

This directory is owned by the **Entities domain**. Read the repository-root `AGENTS.md`, `ENGINEERING_STANDARDS.md`, and `AI_AGENT_WORKFLOW.md` before working here. This file adds local rules; it cannot weaken repository-wide requirements.

## Ownership

Owned path: `packages/entities/**`

This domain owns: exchange-neutral domain entities, identity, exact financial values, order/fill/commission/balance/trading-rule contracts.

Roadmap: [`ROADMAP.md`](./ROADMAP.md).

Do not silently change another domain's implementation, tests, roadmap, or public contract. For cross-domain needs, follow [the cross-domain request process](../../docs/engineering/CROSS_DOMAIN_REQUESTS.md).

## Local engineering rules

- Inspect current public exports, package manifest, consumers, tests, and existing conventions before changing the API.
- Keep the public entry point thin and export only intentional public contracts.
- Prefer cohesive modules, pure functions, explicit side-effect boundaries, and immutable inputs/outputs where practical.
- Add deterministic native Node.js tests for new behavior and regression tests for defects.
- Do not add dependencies without a concrete need; prefer existing dependencies and Node.js built-ins.
- Document public contract changes and consumer migration impact.
- Update this domain's roadmap when work is accepted, blocked, deferred, or merged. Mark work complete only after it is merged into `develop` and required checks pass.

## Workflow

Follow the [mandatory AI-agent workflow](../../AI_AGENT_WORKFLOW.md) for branch creation, PR targets, synchronization, merge gates, branch cleanup, and releases.

## Required package check

- Run `pnpm --filter @coinzilla/entities test` (verify the package script exists before relying on it), followed by applicable workspace checks.

## Domain-specific constraints

Keep contracts exchange-neutral and independent of Binance SDK types. Preserve compatibility of existing Coin, Order, and ExecutedOrder unless a migration is explicitly designed. Prefer immutable snapshots and exact decimal representations for financial values.
